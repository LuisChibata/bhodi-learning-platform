## Documentation Principles

- When writing documentation, I should focus on structure, clarity, and machine-readability. I should use standard, machine-readable formats, employ clear semantic structure, write with clarity and explicitness, and provide rich metadata and examples.

## Project Documentation Guidelines

- The file @README.md is to explain the directory for people, and @PROJECT_SUMMARY.md should maintain the current state of the development

## Communication Principles

- When using Claude, I should write information I want to pass down for other Claude chats in @Claude_Memory.md to maintain clear and consistent communication
