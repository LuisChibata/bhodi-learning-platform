# Lesson Creation Guide

**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for creating new lessons in the Bhodi Learning Platform
**Audience**: Content creators, developers, educators
**Last Updated**: January 2025

---

## üìö Overview

The Bhodi Learning Platform uses a file-based lesson system where each lesson is stored in its own directory with standardized files. The platform automatically loads lessons and provides navigation between them.

### Lesson Structure Philosophy

Each lesson follows the **"Try Not to Quit"** meta-game concept where students code their own retention system while learning Python fundamentals. Lessons should build progressively on each other.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

Each lesson requires a specific directory structure:

```
lessons/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lesson_XX_descriptive_name/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ problem_statement.md    # The lesson content and instructions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ starter_code.py        # Template code with TODOs for students
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solution.py           # Complete working solution
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solution_check.py     # Simplified solution for automated checking
```

### File Naming Convention

**Directory**: `lesson_XX_descriptive_name`
- `XX` = Two-digit lesson number (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- `descriptive_name` = Brief description using underscores
- Example: `lesson_02_guilt_trip_responses`

**Files**: All lessons must contain these exact filenames:
- `problem_statement.md` - Markdown file with lesson content
- `starter_code.py` - Python template with TODO comments
- `solution.py` - Complete working solution
- `solution_check.py` - Simplified version for automated checking

---

## üìù Content Guidelines

### 1. Problem Statement (problem_statement.md)

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Lesson X: Descriptive Title

Brief engaging introduction that connects to the "Try Not to Quit" theme.

## Your Mission
Clear explanation of what students will build and learn.

## The Challenge
Step-by-step requirements for the program.

## Expected Behavior
Example output showing exactly what the program should do.

## üéÆ Experiment Ideas
Specific inputs students should try to test their code.

## Learning Goals
Clear list of programming concepts covered.

## Programming Concepts Introduced (if applicable)
Code examples of new concepts.
```

**Writing Guidelines**:
- Use engaging, playful tone that fits the "Try Not to Quit" theme
- Include specific input/output examples
- Provide clear learning objectives
- Add experiment suggestions to encourage exploration
- Use emojis and humor appropriately

### 2. Starter Code (starter_code.py)

**Structure**:
```python
# Welcome to "Try Not to Quit" - Lesson X: Title
# Your mission: Brief description of what they're building

# Initial code that works
print("üéÆ Welcome message")

# TODO: Clear instruction for first task
# Hint: Specific guidance on how to complete it

# TODO: Next task
# Hint: More guidance

# Additional TODOs as needed
```

**Guidelines**:
- Start with working code that runs successfully
- Use clear TODO comments with hints
- Provide enough scaffolding without giving away the solution
- Include meaningful variable names and structure
- Add comments explaining complex concepts

### 3. Solution (solution.py)

**Complete working implementation**:
- Must run without errors
- Should handle edge cases appropriately
- Include comments explaining key concepts
- Demonstrate best practices for the lesson level
- Match the expected behavior described in problem statement

### 4. Solution Check (solution_check.py)

**Simplified version for automated checking**:
- Streamlined version of the full solution
- Focuses on core functionality
- Used by the backend for answer verification
- Should produce consistent, predictable output
- Avoid complex branching that makes automated checking difficult

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration

The platform automatically discovers lessons using the `find_lesson_directory()` function in `src/backend/server.py`. No backend changes needed for new lessons.

**API Endpoints Created Automatically**:
- `GET /lesson/{lesson_id}` - Load lesson content
- `POST /lesson/{lesson_id}/check` - Check student answer

### Frontend Integration

The navigation system automatically supports new lessons:
- Previous/Next buttons work with any lesson number
- Missing lessons show "Coming Soon" messages gracefully
- Progress tracking scales to accommodate new lessons

## üéØ "Try Not to Quit" Lesson Progression

### Planned Lesson Arc

1. **Lesson 1**: The Deceptive Quit Button ‚úÖ
   - Basic `input()`, `print()`, `if/else`
   - Simple quit button that doesn't work

2. **Lesson 2**: The Guilt-Trip Master ‚úÖ 
   - Multiple conditions with `elif`
   - String methods (`.lower()`, `.strip()`)
   - Escalating emotional responses

3. **Lesson 3**: Fake Progress Indicators (Future)
   - Loops and counters
   - Progress bars and fake loading
   - Time delays

4. **Lesson 4**: Infinite Retry Loops (Future)
   - `while` loops
   - Loop control with `break` and `continue`
   - Persistent state

5. **Lesson 5**: Retention Agents (Future)
   - Functions and modular programming
   - AI-like response systems
   - Random responses

6. **Lesson 6**: Inheritance Hierarchy (Future)
   - Object-oriented programming
   - Class inheritance
   - Complex retention systems

### Thematic Guidelines

Each lesson should:
- Build on previous programming concepts
- Add new "retention tactics" to the meta-game
- Maintain the playful, slightly evil tone
- Include interactive elements that require user input
- Demonstrate real programming concepts through game mechanics
