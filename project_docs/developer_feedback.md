New plan for the development I want.

    1. Create a new lesson that will have some basic exercise and very clear code goals/outputs that the student needs to meet.

2. To create a way so that I can store the submission from my student. That will allow me to see his real time progression as he is coding and notify me of his fails / success. Therefore, there must be a way for the website to record who the student is,  how can this be implemented? Maybe a login function

Start by implementing the new lesson. This new lesson will have something unique. It will have a button function already coded into the website. The aim for the student is to code the logic behind that button. That means, what will happen when pressed, the size of the button and its location.

the button should have the following attributes: Title, position(x,y), action. 

This lesson will be focused on creating the first phase of his game, which will be interacting with the button to try and quit the game. Remember that the idea is to create a game where to objective is to quit from it.

The student will have the chance to interact with the user input by using the button function. Therefore, this new implementation will require to create a new view for this lesson so that the student can interact with the button(s) he creates.

In order to pass, the student must achieve a minimum level of complexity into his game, such as creating a button, changing its title, defining a behaviour and so on.

The website must be able to fully evaluate if the student was able to achieve such level, including tests cases that will give valuable feedback for the student.

The website must be able to somehow store the attemps that the student takes, so that I as a teacher can access them and evaluate how well is my student doing.
