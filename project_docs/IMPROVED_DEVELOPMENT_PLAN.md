# Focused Development Plan - Core Platform with One Lesson

**Platform Development**: This plan builds a fully functional learning platform with one complete lesson. Each step has:
- **Single Clear Goal**: One thing to accomplish
- **Success Criteria**: How to know it worked
- **Test Method**: How to verify it works
- **Rollback Plan**: What to do if it fails

**Final Goal**: Production-ready platform with one perfect lesson following PLATFORM_DESIGN.md principles.

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Steps (8-12)

## Step 8: Lesson Content System
**Goal**: Load lesson content dynamically (problem statement, starter code)
**Success Criteria**: Lesson 1 content loads from files into UI panels
**Test Method**: Navigate to lesson, see content populate correctly

### Implementation:
- Create lesson file structure (`problem_statement.md`, `starter_code.py`, `solution.py`)
- Add backend endpoint to serve lesson content
- Update frontend to load and display lesson content
- Implement Lesson 1: "Try Not to Quit" button

---

## Step 9: Check Answer System
**Goal**: Implement "Check Answer" functionality with educational feedback
**Success Criteria**: Students get meaningful feedback on their solutions
**Test Method**: Submit correct/incorrect code, verify feedback quality

### Implementation:
- Add check answer endpoint that compares student output to solution
- Create educational feedback system (not just correct/incorrect)
- Handle edge cases and common student mistakes
- Follow feedback principles from PLATFORM_DESIGN.md

---

## Step 10: UI Polish & Design Compliance
**Goal**: Ensure platform follows PLATFORM_DESIGN.md principles exactly
**Success Criteria**: Clean, minimalist interface with proper cognitive load management
**Test Method**: Compare implementation against design document

### Implementation:
- Implement proper 3-panel layout with resizing
- Add status indicators ("Ready", "Running...", error states)
- Improve error handling with beginner-friendly messages
- Add proper responsive design for mobile/tablet

---

## Step 11: Platform Security & Performance
**Goal**: Secure code execution with proper timeouts and resource limits
**Success Criteria**: Platform handles malicious/infinite code safely
**Test Method**: Test with infinite loops, resource-heavy code, dangerous operations

### Implementation:
- Implement robust timeout system
- Add resource limits (memory, CPU)
- Sanitize file operations and dangerous imports
- Add rate limiting for code execution

---

## Step 12: Final Testing & Deployment
**Goal**: Production-ready platform with one complete lesson
**Success Criteria**: Platform works flawlessly for real students
**Test Method**: End-to-end testing with actual lesson completion

### Implementation:
- Comprehensive testing of complete lesson workflow
- Performance optimization and bug fixes
- Final deployment and monitoring setup
- Documentation for lesson content creation

---

## Testing Strategy for Each Step

### Before Each Step:
1. **Backup**: Commit current working state
2. **Plan**: Write down what you're going to change
3. **Test**: Verify current functionality still works

### During Each Step:
1. **Isolate**: Change only what's needed for this step
2. **Incremental**: Make smallest possible changes
3. **Test Early**: Test as soon as something might work

### After Each Step:
1. **Verify**: Run the step's test method
2. **Regression**: Ensure previous steps still work
3. **Commit**: Save working state before next step

### If Step Fails:
1. **Rollback**: Return to last working state
2. **Analyze**: What went wrong?
3. **Adjust**: Modify approach or break step down further
4. **Retry**: Attempt again with new approach

## ðŸš€ Post-Launch Strategy

Once the core platform with one lesson is complete:

1. **Student Testing**: Deploy lesson to real students
2. **Performance Analysis**: Collect data on student interactions
3. **Lesson 2 Design**: Create next lesson based on student data
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Refine platform based on usage

This focused approach ensures we build one excellent lesson rather than many mediocre ones, following educational best practices and maintaining high code quality throughout.
