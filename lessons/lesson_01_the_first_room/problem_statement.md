# Lesson 1: The Deceptive Quit Button

Welcome to **"Try Not to Quit"** - a game where the goal is supposedly to quit, but quitting becomes increasingly difficult and entertaining!

## Your Mission

Create a program that appears to let the user quit, but actually makes quitting impossible (or at least very amusing). This lesson teaches you the basics of:

- `print()` statements for output
- `input()` for user interaction  
- Variables to store user choices
- Basic conditional logic with `if/else`

## The Challenge

Your program should:

1. **Welcome the user** to the "Try Not to Quit" game
2. **Ask the user** if they want to quit
3. **Respond cleverly** when they try to quit (make it fail in a funny way)
4. **Continue the game** regardless of their choice

## Expected Behavior

When a user runs your code and types "quit", they should see something like:

```
🎮 Welcome to TRY NOT TO QUIT!
Your mission: Find a way to exit this program.
Type 'quit' to quit: quit
❌ ERROR: Quit function temporarily disabled for maintenance
Please try again later... or don't. 😏
🔄 Game continues whether you like it or not!
```

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand:
- How to display messages to users with `print()`
- How to get input from users with `input()`
- How to store user responses in variables
- How to make decisions in your code with `if/else` statements
- The concept of program flow control
