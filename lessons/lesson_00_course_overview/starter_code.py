# Welcome to The Academy Chronicles!
# This is where your coding journey begins.

# Let's start with a simple greeting to set the mood
print("ðŸŽ® Welcome to The Academy Chronicles! ðŸŽ®")
print("Your coding adventure is about to begin...")

# TODO: In the coming lessons, this simple print statement will evolve into:
# - Character creation system
# - Inventory management  
# - Combat mechanics
# - Web interface
# - Multiplayer features
# - And much more!

# For now, let's just imagine what's possible:
print("Imagine creating a character like this:")
print("Character Name: Hero")
print("Class: Warrior") 
print("Health: 100")
print("Level: 1")

print("Ready to make this imagination become reality?")
print("Let's start coding! ðŸš€")
