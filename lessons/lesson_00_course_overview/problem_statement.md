# Welcome to Your HSC Software Engineering Journey! üéÆ

## The Big Picture: From Zero to Game Developer in 12 Weeks

Welcome! Over the next 12 weeks, you're going to transform from someone who lacks coding confidence into a confident software engineer who has built a complete game from scratch. But this isn't just about building a game - **every single line of code you write will be directly preparing you for your HSC Software Engineering exam**.

## üéØ Your Mission: Build "The Academy Chronicles"

You'll be creating **"The Academy Chronicles"** - a text-based RPG adventure game that will evolve into a sophisticated web-based application. This game will tell the story of a student navigating through different "academies" (levels) learning various skills, facing challenges, and growing stronger.

But here's the secret: **each academy in your game represents a module from your HSC curriculum**, and each challenge your character faces will teach you real software engineering concepts!
