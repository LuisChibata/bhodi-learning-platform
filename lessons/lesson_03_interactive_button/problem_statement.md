# Lesson 3: Interactive Button Master

Welcome to the next level of **"Try Not to Quit"** - where you'll create your first interactive game interface!

## Your Mission

Build a visual button system where users can click actual buttons on screen. Your buttons should be positioned exactly where you want them and perform specific actions when clicked. This lesson teaches you:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Creating classes and objects
- **Visual Positioning**: Controlling x,y coordinates on screen
- **Event Handling**: Programming button click behaviors
- **Game Interface Design**: Building interactive user interfaces

## The Challenge

Create a `Button` class with these requirements:

1. **Button Properties**:
   - `title`: Text displayed on the button
   - `x`: Horizontal position (0-800 pixels)
   - `y`: Vertical position (0-600 pixels)  
   - `action`: What happens when clicked

2. **Button Behavior**:
   - When clicked, execute the button's programmed action
   - For "quit" buttons, implement creative quit-prevention
   - Display appropriate messages for different button types

3. **Visual Requirements**:
   - Create at least 2 different buttons
   - Position them in different locations
   - Make at least one button attempt to quit (but fail entertainingly)

## Expected Visual Result

Your code should create buttons that appear in the **Button Canvas** (the visual area that appears when you minimize this problem statement). Users should be able to click these buttons and see your programmed responses.

## Example Button Behavior

```
Button: "Quit Game" at position (200, 100)
Click Result: "‚ùå ERROR: Quit button is on coffee break. Try again never!"

Button: "Help" at position (400, 200)  
Click Result: "üí° HELP: The only help you need is to stop trying to quit!"
```

## üéÆ Button Canvas

After you minimize this problem statement, you'll see a **Button Canvas** where your programmed buttons will appear. As you code and run your program, you'll see your buttons rendered visually and can click them to test your logic!

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand:
- How to create classes with multiple attributes
- How to position visual elements with coordinates
- How to define object methods and behaviors
- How to build interactive user interfaces
- The basics of event-driven programming

## Getting Started

1. **Minimize this problem statement** (Ctrl+H) to see the Button Canvas
2. **Study the starter code** to understand the Button class structure
3. **Run your code** to see your buttons appear in the canvas
4. **Click the buttons** to test their behaviors
5. **Experiment** with different positions and actions
