# Lesson 2: The Guilt-Trip Master

Welcome back to **"Try Not to Quit"**! Your deceptive quit button was just the beginning. Now it's time to level up your retention tactics with psychological manipulation... I mean, "user engagement strategies" 😈

## Your Mission

Build upon your previous lesson by adding multiple layers of guilt-tripping responses that make users feel terrible about wanting to quit. This lesson teaches you:

- Multiple `if/elif/else` conditions
- String methods like `.lower()` for flexible input handling
- Nested conditional logic
- Creating emotional responses through code
- Advanced user manipulation... er, retention techniques

## The Challenge

Your program should:

1. **Welcome returning players** to the enhanced "Try Not to Quit" experience
2. **Ask if they want to quit** (like before)
3. **Detect various quit attempts** (quit, exit, bye, stop, etc.)
4. **Respond with guilt-inducing messages** that get progressively more manipulative
5. **Track quit attempts** and escalate the guilt with each try
6. **Never actually let them quit** (of course!)

## Expected Behavior

When a user tries different ways to quit, they should see escalating guilt responses:

```
🎮 Welcome back to TRY NOT TO QUIT! (Enhanced Edition)
We've missed you SO much! Don't you dare leave us again...

What would you like to do? (hint: definitely don't type 'quit'): quit

💔 REALLY?! After everything we've been through together?
😢 I spent all night preparing this lesson just for you...
🥺 But I guess my feelings don't matter to you, do they?

*sniffle* Fine... what do you want to do now?: exit

😱 EXIT?! That's even WORSE than quit!
💸 Do you know how much money was spent developing this platform?
👥 Think of all the developers who worked nights and weekends!
🌍 Somewhere, a kitten is crying because you want to leave...

*dramatically sobbing* One more chance... please?: bye

🚨 EMOTIONAL DAMAGE DETECTED! 🚨
🧠 Our advanced AI has determined you have abandonment issues
📊 Statistics show that 97.3% of quitters regret their decision
⏰ You've already invested 3.7 minutes - why waste it now?

🔄 The game continues because we care about your success!
💪 (Whether you like it or not)
```

## 🎮 Experiment Ideas

Test your guilt-trip system with various inputs:

**Basic quit attempts:**
- `quit`, `exit`, `bye`, `stop`, `leave`

**Sneaky attempts:**
- `q`, `x`, `goodbye`, `farewell`

**Creative attempts:**
- `please let me go`, `I want out`, `escape`

**Resistance testing:**
- Try the same quit word multiple times
- Mix uppercase/lowercase: `QUIT`, `Quit`, `qUiT`

**💡 Learning Tip:** Use the "🎮 Try Different Input" button to quickly test how your guilt-trip responses escalate!

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand:
- How to use `elif` for multiple conditions
- String methods like `.lower()` and `.strip()` for robust input handling
- How to track state with variables (counting quit attempts)
- Nested conditional logic for complex decision making
- The psychology of user retention (and why it's hilariously evil)

## Programming Concepts Introduced

### Multiple Conditions with elif
```python
if choice == "quit":
    # Handle quit
elif choice == "exit":
    # Handle exit  
elif choice == "bye":
    # Handle goodbye
else:
    # Handle everything else
```

### String Methods for Flexible Input
```python
choice = input("What do you want? ").lower().strip()
# Now "QUIT", "Quit", " quit " all become "quit"
```

### State Tracking
```python
quit_attempts = 0
quit_attempts += 1  # Count how many times they tried to quit
```
