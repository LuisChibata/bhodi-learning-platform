- **Type**: Educational Python Learning Platform
- **Concept**: "Try Not to Quit" meta-game where students code retention mechanisms
- **Status**: Production-ready with comprehensive code review completed (July 2025)
- **Quality**: Grade B+ (Good) - Strong foundations with minor improvements needed

- `README.md`: Directory explanation for newcomers
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`: Current development state and technical details
- `project_docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`: Post-review enhancement roadmap
- `project_docs/INPUT_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md`: Technical analysis of input system

## Current State Summary
- **Development**: Steps 1-13 completed (100%)
- **Code Review**: Completed July 2025 with B+ grade
- **Production URLs**: 
  - Frontend: https://bhodi-coding-plataform.netlify.app
  - Backend: https://bhodi-learning-backend.fly.dev
- **Architecture**: Flask backend + HTML/CSS/JS frontend
- **Deployment**: Netlify (frontend) + Fly.io (backend)

## Critical Issues Identified
1. **Security**: 2 moderate npm dependency vulnerabilities (fixable with `npm audit fix`)
2. **Testing**: 0% test coverage (critical gap)
3. **Code Quality**: Large functions need refactoring
4. **Documentation**: Missing API documentation

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. Run `npm audit fix` to address security vulnerabilities
2. Implement testing framework (pytest + jest)
3. Add code quality tools (ESLint, Flake8)
4. Follow 5-week improvement plan

## Communication Guidelines
- Use machine-readable formats
- Employ clear semantic structure
- Write with clarity and explicitness
- Provide rich metadata and examples
- Focus on actionable information
